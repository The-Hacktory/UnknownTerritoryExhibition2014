Unknown Territory: New Art From The Hacktory
============================================

Exhibition Description
======================
For the past 6 months, artists have been hard at work at The Hacktory exploring and creating artwork. A result of a successful crowdfunding campaign and with support from the Knight Arts Foundation, the first Unknown Territory Fellowship and Artist-In-Residency program supports artists interested in creating and experimenting with art and technology such as cameras, projectors, sensors, robots, software and circuits to create new experiences and new possibilities with code, hardware and creative expression.
The artwork featured in the exhibition consist of interactive works such as GPS-based music compositions and costumes, MIDI music devices, playful games, auto-generated artwork, projection mapped self-portraits, a comet observatory, self-aware smartphones and more.
Artists included in the exhibition are Michael Kiley (Philadelphia), Maximillian Lawrence (Philadelphia), Jacob Rivkin (Philadelphia), Tara Webb (Philadelphia), Robert Spahr (Illinois), New American Public Art's Bevan Weissman and Dan Sternoff Beyer (Boston/Philadelphia), Thiago Hersan (Oakland/São Paulo), and Jenna Frye (Baltimore). 
The Hacktory was formed in 2007 to provide classes in topics like circuits, programming, and robotics for personal development, and  to form a creative social group to collaborate with. Our mission is to inspire anyone to use technology for personal expression, and involves technology education and an atmosphere where artists, scientists, and programmers alike can feel comfortable asking questions and experimenting.

Robert Spahr
Sabot Cruft (Nine Quilts For Move)
Upon my arrival to Philadelphia I began to think about the places and things in Philadelphia that I was familiar with such as Independence Hall, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and the Liberty Bell but I soon found myself driving daily through West Philadelphia. Like other large cities such as New York and Chicago, Philadelphia was reminding me that one only needs to turn a corner to find that one street separating neighborhoods of affluence and those of poverty. Each day I imagined passing through the thin membranes separating these neighborhoods, trying to sense the pressures pushing from both sides. These nine quilts are created using breaking news images gathered from Philadelphia's 6abc Action News - WPVI website.

My art practice reflects on our relationship to media technologies, especially surveillance and mind control, and in the process contemplates what a post-human art may look like. Digital collages called Cruft are created by scraping the web using computational algorithms that remix mainstream media sites like CNN with social networks of individuals, and reproduce, in mimicry of the 24/7 media cycle, the narrow choices permitted in public discourse. 

Like other large cities such as New York and Chicago, Philadelphia was reminding me that one only needs to turn a corner to find that one street separating neighborhoods of affluence and those of poverty. Each day I imagined passing through the thin membranes separating these neighborhoods, trying to sense the pressures pushing from both sides. Some days the temperature was much hotter on one side than the other.

Stack of Surprise
The dodecahedron: heralded as the Shape of the Universe, this "fifth element" was the very last of the Platonic solids to be discovered. The Pythagoreans of old realized that you could derive Irrationality from the mathematics hidden in its geometry. Then they drowned one of their members for divulging its secrets to the public.

As part of the "Unknown Territory" fellowship at The Hacktory, we created some new ways of cheaply producing arbitrary shapes and volumes, such as the dodecahedron. We automated this process with laser cutter technology, made it affordable with coroplast material, and open sourced the methods to the public.

GIRIH
Jenna Frye
GIRIH is based on a form of geometric interlaced strapwork ornamentation that is commonly found in architecture throughout the Islamic world. GIRIH is the Persian word for “knot” and refers to the complex system of decorative patterns that emerge upon the specific arrangement of 5 fundamental tiles. Medieval Islamic designers used this patterning system to form elaborate and breathtaking architectural pieces at least 500 years before Western mathematics was able to define it. When you play with GIRIH tiles, you’re participating in an ancient design practice of intuitive, visual and symbolic mark making. Enjoy!

Thiago Hersan
memememe
If conversation and identity arise together, as proposed by Gordon Pask’s Conversation Theory, what are the consequences (or limitations) of communicating without an other? Can we just as easily construct our identity and our environment while talking to ourselves? What is the sound of a one-sided conversation?

memememe#selfie is a sculpture that might be the first instance of artificial unintelligence. Before being able to converse and commune with each other, it is important for the cellphones to recognize themselves and confront the duality of self/other. Instead of using digital communication, they will transfer information and express themselves visually through their screens and cameras, and aurally through their microphones and speakers. They will use custom software to interpret not only the literal content of each message, but also how it is being transmitted.

Jacob Rivkin
Keep the wind on your right cheek
Keep the wind on your right cheek gets the local wind speed for Philadelphia from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website and uses a microcontroller and a small fan to blow the corresponding wind speed out through the sculpture. The form is based on the shape of the wind commonly seen blowing from the mouths of deities and gods in maps from antiquity. The title comes from a phrase I learned from my step-father when sailing - in order to keep a full sail it was important to be aware of the wind.

Jacob Rivkin
Compass for mountains and water
Compass for mountains and water is a working compass housed within a suitcase that points to the closest inland body of water and closest mountain. It uses GPS, two stepper motors, a digital compass, and a small microcontroller to direct two pointers.  A list of coordinates of the of bodies of water and mountains are hardcoded into the microcontroller so the GPS cross-reference your current location with the stored ones and returns the closest point which each pointer will direct you towards.

Jacob Rivkin
Wish Booth
Wish Booth uses a web-scraping program to compile videos from the NASA All-Sky Fireball Network - which is a series of cameras installed across the country to capture video each night of meteorites entering our atmosphere. These black and white videos are compiled into one video and played on the ceiling of the booth when a coin is inserted into the booth’s coin slot.

Maximillian Lawrence
“Its Not Real, but its Good!”
OR The Party, The Room, The People, The Mic, The Words, The Song, The Applause : TTTTTTT
During the past 6 month of his residency at The Hacktory, Maximillian Lawrence has been exploring karaoke as a generative and expressive creative tool. Through the use of its almost open source nature and the deconstruction of its file format in conjunction with its contextual subversion he has produced mutated permutations of some of the most famous Bar Mitzvah and bachelorette party hymns. The TTTTTTT aka AKM aka Automata Karaoke Machine AKA Terminal Busking was a work of deep exploration and experimentation including with Hacktory Fellow Thiago Hersan in the creation of an automata karaoke machine in which the machine plays itself.


Tara Webb
Home is _________.
In Gaston Bauchelard’s book THE POETICS OF SPACE, he points out “one must live to build one’s house, not build one’s house to live in.”  Home is______. is a meditation on defining how we ‘wear’ place. The objects ask: how do we define our selves within our environments? And do our outward appearances act like mirrors to reflect our inner imaginations? We are always dreamers dreaming. 

Michael Kiley
Elegy For A Home
A tour of an empty home the day before settlement. Using the GPS in an iPhone, binaural recordings are mapped inside of the gallery, juxtaposing the retelling of memories in a South Philly row home against a raw space. 

Michael Kiley
In(determinate) Duet
Create a movement and sound piece by moving in space. Change your location inside of the given area to trigger different sounds, moving as expressively or as mundanely as you like. By wearing the sound source, you become not only the impulse for the sound, but the source itself.
