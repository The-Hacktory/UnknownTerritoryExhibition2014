Exhibition Description
======================
For the past 6 months, artists have been hard at work at The Hacktory exploring and creating artwork. A result of a successful crowdfunding campaign and with support from the Knight Arts Foundation, the first Unknown Territory Fellowship and Artist-In-Residency program supports artists interested in creating and experimenting with art and technology such as cameras, projectors, sensors, robots, software and circuits to create new experiences and new possibilities with code, hardware and creative expression. The artwork featured in the exhibition consist of interactive works such as GPS-based music compositions and costumes, MIDI music devices, playful games, auto-generated artwork, projection mapped self-portraits, a comet observatory, self-aware smartphones and more. Artists included in the exhibition are Michael Kiley (Philadelphia), Maximillian Lawrence (Philadelphia), Jacob Rivkin (Philadelphia), Tara Webb (Philadelphia), Robert Spahr (Illinois), New American Public Art's Bevan Weissman and Dan Sternoff Beyer (Boston/Philadelphia), Thiago Hersan (Oakland/SÃ£o Paulo), and Jenna Frye (Baltimore). The Hacktory was formed in 2007 to provide classes in topics like circuits, programming, and robotics for personal development, and to form a creative social group to collaborate with. Our mission is to inspire anyone to use technology for personal expression, and involves technology education and an atmosphere where artists, scientists, and programmers alike can feel comfortable asking questions and experimenting.
